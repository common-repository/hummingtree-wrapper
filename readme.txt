HummingTree is an easy way to show ads from smaller businesses and brands on your blog or website.

== Description ==

HummingTree is an easy way to show advertisements created by business owners, activists and everyday people -- not by expensive ad agencies. Without any minimum site traffic requirements (unlike current ad networks), any site or blog can make a little money while helping out local businesses and neighbors!

Use HummingTree to:
* Earn money with every ad you show
* Show ads from smaller businesses, brands, and movements
* Not track user data and instead, self-tag your site to choose more relevant ads for your audience
* Share more relevant and local ads that won’t annoy or creep out your audience

== Why HummingTree? ==

We’re on a mission to democratize advertising by giving people the power to easily and affordably create ads. We don’t believe ads should only be for big companies with big ad budgets, we want to build a more level playing field.

== How does it work? ==

Using our free mobile app, people create affordable template ads in minutes. In the creation process, people tag their ad from a list of pre-determined tags. To help find a relevant audience, we’ll match those tags with relevant sites and blogs who self tag their sites from the same list. This way, we avoid creepy and invasive tracking of your audience.
